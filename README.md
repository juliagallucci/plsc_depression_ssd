## Uncovering the Seperable Dimensions of Depression, Negative Symptoms, and Guilt in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Neural Circuitry and Clinical Implications


Importance: Depressive symptoms in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) impact suicidality, prognosis, and quality of life. Treatment options are limited, likely due to presumed comorbidities with major depressive disorder and difficulty differentiating them from negative symptoms.

Objective: To identify the neural circuitry of depressive symptoms in SSD and distinguish distinct and overlapping connectivity patterns with negative symptoms.

Design and setting: Cross-sectional cohort analysis of three university hospital neuroimaging studies conducted between September 2013 and December 2018.

Participants: Data from 360 individuals with SSD were extracted. Post quality-control, 157 patients who manifested varying degrees of depressive symptoms were examined, including 33 who participated in a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) trial.

Main outcomes and measures: Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC) was applied to identify associations between functional connectivity and both depressive and negative symptoms, assessed using the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, respectively. Functional connectivity of 392 regions of interest was derived as correlations between their mean time series obtained from a 7-minute resting-state fMRI scan.

Results: PLSC identified three connectivity-symptom profiles. The first profile linked general depressive symptoms to altered connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Visual2 Network (VIS2), and between the DMN, Frontoparietal Network (FPN), and Cingulo-Opercular Network (CON). The second profile linked negative symptoms to altered between-network connectivity of the FPN to CON and DMN and within the VIS2. The third profile linked guilt and early wakening symptoms to altered connectivity between the DMN to FPN and within the VIS2. rTMS reduced depressive but not guilt-related symptoms.

Conclusions and relevance: Findings revealed highly correlated connectivity features with specific aspects of depressive symptoms, which varied in treatment outcomes, and identified shared and distinct network patterns with negative symptoms. This could serve as a foundation for elucidating the underlying aetiological mechanisms of depression in SSD, and the development of more targeted and effective treatments.
